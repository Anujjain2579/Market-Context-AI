## Market Context

In Q2 2025, the U.S. small-cap equity market operated against a backdrop of moderate economic growth and stable inflation. Real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.8%, while headline CPI inflation stood at 2.7% year-over-year. The Federal Reserve maintained a policy rate of 4.33%, with the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield near 4.17%. Labor market conditions remained tight, as reflected by a low unemployment rate of 3.4%. Currency movements included a notable depreciation of the USD against the Japanese yen (-3.76%) and an appreciation versus the euro (+9.20%). Commodity prices showed mixed signals, with the All Commodities index at 165.8, up 3.3% month-over-month but down 0.6% year-over-year. Geopolitical and policy factors related to digital assets such as bitcoin, crypto, gold, and stablecoins were noted but without specific impact details.

The Russell 2000 index, representing U.S. small-cap equities, delivered a total return of 8.46% during the quarter. Sector performance was uneven: Information Technology led strongly with a proxy ETF return of 22.0%, followed by Communication Services at 12.7%. Conversely, Health Care and Energy sectors lagged, returning -5.5% and -9.0%, respectively. Data on market breadth, factor rotation, and style trends were not provided, limiting further insight into underlying market dynamics.

The quarter featured pronounced volatility early in April. On April 3, small-cap stocks declined sharply by 6.42%, followed by a further 4.46% drop on April 4. This selloff was reversed on April 9, when the Russell 2000 surged 8.5%, signaling renewed optimism among investors. These swings underscore the sensitivity of the small-cap segment to headline-driven market sentiment during the period.
